- fix init.c : in init_philos I have too many arg!
- add functions for freeing malloc (I should've done this, but I will probably need to make some functions to make it more optimal, since I will have too many lines in main otherwise)
- test is everything working that is made by now.
- fix simulation.c and change everythiing so it's working!!
