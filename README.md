- I can't use exit! change it everywhere! (should be done)
- fix init.c : in init_philos I have too many arg!
- add functions for freeing malloc (I should've done this, but I will probably need to make some functions to make it more optimal, since I will have too many lines in main otherwise)
- test is everything working that is made by now.
- try to change everything so that I have only one struct, not milion of them, so it's easier to organize stuff. and change evrything according to that.
